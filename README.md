# Predictive-Quality-for-Arc-Welding---Time-Series
I have implemented the four supervised machine learning algorithms Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and 𝑘-Nearest Neighbors on sensor data from 32 welding procedures with different types of error patterns. I observed that the Logistic Regression Algorithm has shown maximum accuracy for testing the new data set with nearly 0.99.
